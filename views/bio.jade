			h2 My name is Cameron Steele and I am a freelance composer and sound designer who lives in Melbourne, Australia.

			p I have been interested in music for many years and have completed a Bachelor of Music (Composition). I have studied voice and bass guitar and continue to study guitar, piano and orchestration. Visual art has always been an important part of my life and at a very young age I found myself interested in the music as much as the art itself. I was fascinated at how much the music and sound influenced my opinion of video games and film.

			p I began making remixes of existing video game music such as Donkey Kong*, Tales of Symphonia*, Legends of Zelda* and Golden Sun* which led to an interest in composing my own music. I enjoy creating music that takes artwork to the next level. Inspiration is usually scenery and a sense of place, artwork and characters.

			p I write music every day and my work has been included on a re-mix album called BadAss 3. I also have experience film-scoring for short films.
			
			p I enjoy writing melodic and thematic music but I am able to write music in a number of styles including but not limited to, Metal*, Dubstep*, Celtic*, Orchestral* and Horror* in order to be versatile and take on any project.

			p When it comes to projects I always try to be as creative and as flexible as possible. I always listen to what creators have to say and am open to all kinds of feedback regarding my music and sound.
